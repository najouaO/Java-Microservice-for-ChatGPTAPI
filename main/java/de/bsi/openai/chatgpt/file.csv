"""What is gluten sensitivity?""","

Gluten sensitivity is a condition characterized by a person's adverse reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It is also known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity or gluten intolerance. Symptoms of gluten sensitivity can include digestive issues such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea; fatigue; headaches; joint or muscle pain; and skin issues such as rashes and eczema.  Treatment for gluten sensitivity may involve following a gluten-free diet, which involves avoiding foods and products containing wheat, barley, and rye among other foods."

"""What is gluten sensitivity?""","

Gluten sensitivity is a condition where a person may experience physical symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation and headaches after consuming foods that contain gluten. Gluten sensitivity is not the same as celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten. People with gluten sensitivity do not have the same antibody response to gluten as those with celiac disease, but they may still experience similar symptoms."
